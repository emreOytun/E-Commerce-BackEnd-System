# E-Commerce-BackEndSystem
Back-end design for an e-commerce system is designed with multi-layered architecture according 
to SOLID principles and simulated.

-> Eclipse IDE is used to develop the project.

# Requirements: 

Criterias to sign up and login into an e-commerce system is written below. You need to write Java Backend for this system.

Users can sign up entering their information to the system.

A user can sign up with basic user information, email and password.


Basic User Informations : First name, last name, e-mail, password. All basic informations are must.<br>
Password must contain at least 6 characters.<br>
E-mail should not be used before.<br>
First name and last name should contain at least 2 characters.<br>
A verification mail should sent to the user after sign up. (Simulation)<br>
Signing up is completed when clicking the verification link. (Simulation)<br>
User should be informed at the success or error situations.<br>
Users can sign up the server using their Google accounts. (Simulation)<br>

Other authorization services can be used later. (Design your system open to external service integration.)<br>

Simulate these requirements by designing a multi-tier architecture.<br>
